# 🐍 GitHub Contribution Snake

This repository hosts an animated representation of my GitHub contributions using the awesome [`Platane/snk`](https://github.com/Platane/snk) GitHub Action.

> The snake animation is updated daily via GitHub Actions and embedded in my [GitHub profile README](https://github.com/Akshat-mittal1/Akshat-mittal1).

## 📦 Output Files (auto-generated)

These files are pushed to the `output` branch:

- `github-contribution-grid-snake.svg`
- `github-contribution-grid-snake-dark.svg`
- `github-contribution-grid-snake.gif`

They are generated based on my GitHub activity and hosted using GitHub Pages.
